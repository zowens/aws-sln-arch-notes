# Simple Storage Service

## Basics
* Object store, highly available
* Secure (encryption at rest, in transit)
* 5TB file maximum, 0 byte minimum
* Read-after-write consistency for new objects
* Global bucket naming

## Storage Levels
* Standard
    * 12 9's of durability
    * Low latency
    * 99.99% available
* Standard - Infrequent Access
    * 99.9% available
    * Storage cheaper than standard, pay per GB of retrieval
    * Great for DR, backups, or long term storage
    * Must be in this level for 30 days (minimum charge)
* Reduced Redundancy 
    * 99.99% durable
    * Storage level with lower replication factor
    * Generally advised to only be used for reproducible work (e.g. thumbnails, transcoded media)

* Lifecycle policies can transition objects from higher levels to lower levels levels, and delete

## Cost
* Data Transfer
    * No data transfer cost b/w EC2 or S3 within the same region
    * No data transfer cost to Cloudfront
    * No data transfer cost into S3
    * Low data transfer cost to another region
    * Data transfer cost to internet, varies on size
* Storage
    * Based on storage level, standard > RR > IA > glacier
* Requester pays - Requester of the objects pay for data transfer (not storage)

## Various Features
* S3 Inventory
* Transfer Acceleration
    * Pay per GB
    * Request will hit the nearest cloudfront POP, transfer to S3 quicker
    * Cloudfront POST/PUT can be cheaper for files < 1gb
* Versioning
    * Stores all versions of an object
    * Lifecycle rules can control non-current version retention
    * Uses delete markers to prevent accidental deletion (some amount of time for recovery)
    * Versioned objects can be transitioned to Glacier
* BitTorrent 
* Amazon DevPay - charge customers for the S3 data retrieval
* Cross-Region Replication
    * Replicate for a single target region
    * Some restrictions (no bi-directional replication)
    * No retroactive replication
* Read-after-write consistency for new objects, eventual consistency otherwise

## Security
* Access Control
    * Bucket Policy
        * IAM-looking policy document to describe allowed actions on resources
        * Conditions can include encryption keys, source IP, copy source, storage class, prefix, version, tag, ACL
    * Bucket ACLs / Object-level ACLs
        * Control access to resources within the bucket
        * Built-in groups
            * Authenticated Uers within the AWS account of the origin object
            * All Users (All AWS users)
            * Log Delivery group (write permission for log delivery)
        * Canned policies
            * public
            * private - Owner has full control
            * public-read
            * authenticated-read
            * bucket-owner-read
            * bucket-owner-full-control
            * log-delivery-write
    * User policy is stored in IAM
* SSE
    * SSE-S3 - Amazon controlled key rotation
    * SSE-C - Per-object encryption key (AES-256)
    * SSE-KMS - KMS-based encryption, also adds audit trail within KMS
* MFA Delete 
    * Requires MFA-ed session to delete objects from S3
    * Can also require any operation be used with MFA
* Access Logs can track requests
* CORS
* Notifications
* Tagging (Object-level)
* VPC endpoints
* S3 Analytics - Storage Class Analysis


## Glacier
* Archive storage
* 12 9's of durability
* Low cost, can take time to recover (minutes to first byte/hours)
* Minimum 90 days of storage
* S3
    * S3 objects transitioned into Glacier must be requested via S3 APIs
    * Transitioned to RRS
* Levels of access
    * Expedited - 1-5 minutes to retrieve
    * Standard - 3-5 hours
    * Bulk - 5-12 hours

* ... compliance
